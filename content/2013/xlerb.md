If you have somehow managed to find this site, you are either curious
about the name Xlerb, or you already know what it means. If you already
know what it means, then there's probably not much point in reading
further.

Xlerb is a "word that doesn't exist in the dictionary." It was coined by
Leo Brodie in the seminal programming tome
[Starting Forth](http://www.forth.com/starting-forth/).
